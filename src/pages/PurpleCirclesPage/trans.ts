    refer to colors that are between red and blue in hue, with purples

    resultText: `As a result, when violet light strikes the eye, the S-cone is stimulated 
    strongly and the L-cone is stimulated weakly. Accordingly, strong blue light mixed with
     weaker red light can mimic this pattern of stimulation, causing humans to perceive 
     colors that the same hue as violet, but with lower saturation.`,
